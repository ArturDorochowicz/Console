1. OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Console  Plugin creates  a console  window where  user can  run other   plugins'
services, see their return values, check and set variables and operate on flags.
It can be a very helpful tool during plugin development.

The plugin was tested with PowerPro 3.8

2. LEGAL STUFF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a  freeware  program. You  may distribute  it  freely, but  you must not
request or  accept any  amount of money  or other  payment for it.  You must not
change this program's contents  in any way. And, by  the way, you use it at your
own risk.  Distribution is fully  allowed as  long as the plugin  (i.e. plugin's
.dll file and  this .txt info  file) remain  unchanged. When  distributing, both
plugin files (.dll and .txt) must be included.

PowerPro and plugin template are Copyright (C) by Bruce Switzer.

3. INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to  use the  plugin, you  should place  it in  your PowerPro  'plugins'
directory.  If you do not have  'plugins'  directory,  you  probably  have older
version of PowerPro.  In this case place the plugin  directly  in your  PowerPro
directory. After that you can use its services just like services from any other
plugin. Read PowerPro's help for general information on using plugins.

4. SERVICES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
show ()
        Creates a console window. Only one  console window can exist  at a  time
        and thus  when a  console window  is shown,  consecutive calls to show()
        service  are ignored.

close ()
        Closes a console window. This  operation deletes all information in  the
        console window, which means that next call to show() service will create
        a completely  new console  window: empty,  with no  watches set, with no
        information about previously used commands.

Plugin's services do not take any arguments, so you do not have to use brackets.

5. PLUGIN USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the console is shown, the following commands can be used:

exit
        Closes console window. Works like close() service.

set
        Sets the value of the variable.
        Syntax:
               set variablename value

        'value' argument can be omitted and than the variable is cleared.
        Names of variables cannot be longer than 63 characters.

get
        Returns the value of the variable.
        Syntax:
               get variablename

        Names of variables cannot be longer than 63 characters.
	'Get' cannot be used to check values of PowerPro keywords.       

flag
        Performs operations on flags.
        Syntax:
               flag set n1 n2
               flag clear n1 n2
               flag reverse n1 n2
        This commands will set or clear or toggle flags of numbers from n1 to n2.
        'n2' argument can be omitted.

watch1, ..., watch5
        Sets watches at positions from 1 to 5.
        Syntax:
               watch1 variablename

        This command sets watch 1 to 'variablename'.
        Names of variables cannot be longer than 63 characters.

	Watches for PowerPro keywords are not supported.

won
        Turnes watches on.
        Syntax:
               won interval

        'interval' argument specifies the  interval in seconds between  checking
        variables on the watch list. If  it  is  omitted then  the deafult value
        of 3 seconds is used.
        Below the list of watches, there is a list with all PowerPro flags shown
        with this format: flagnumber(state)

woff
        Turnes watches off.

Any other commands are send to PowerPro for evaluation.
Through evaluation you can do the following:

- run services from plugins and get their return values:
        plugin.service(arguments...)

- get values of PowerPro keywords:
        e.g. pprofolder, pproversion, date, time and so on.

- get status of PowerPro flags:
        pproflag(flag number)

- get values of regular PowerPro variables, it then works like 'get' command.

You can use up and down arrows to cycle through the list of previous commands.

Unloading  Console Plugin  from within  a console  window is  not supported  and
command: console.unload is ignored.
